# Computer-Graphics-Algorithms
GraphicsAlgorithms is an open-source repository implementing foundational and advanced computer graphics algorithms across rasterization, geometry processing, rendering, and computational geometry. Designed for researchers, educators, and developers, it provides modular, optimized code samples in C++/Python with cross-platform support and interactive visualizations. Key features include:

Core Algorithms

Rasterization: DDA/Bresenham's line drawing 10, midpoint circle/ellipse, scanline polygon filling.

Transformations: 2D/3D translation/scaling/rotation, perspective projection 7.

Curves & Surfaces: BÃ©zier, B-spline, and subdivision surfaces 6.

Mesh Processing: Simplification, curvature computation, and mesh repair 6.

Advanced Modules

Clipping: Cohen-Sutherland (line), Sutherland-Hodgman (polygon) 15.

Physics & Animation: Particle systems, skeletal animation.

GPU Acceleration: OpenGL 4.6/DirectX 11 integration for real-time rendering 7.

Educational Tools

Jupyter Notebook tutorials with mathematical derivations.

Interactive visualizations using OpenGL/Matplotlib 10.

Replicability badges for verified implementations 15.

Development Standards

Continuous integration (GitHub Actions).

CMake-based builds for Linux/Windows/macOS 7.

Unit tests covering >90% of code.
